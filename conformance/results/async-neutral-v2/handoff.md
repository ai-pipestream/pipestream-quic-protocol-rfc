# Handoff — B: neutral failure/resource certification (Kimi)

Status: IN PROGRESS — NOT REVIEW_READY. Rust-only preparation and the
first both-direction rows exist; the whole B contract has NOT passed.
This file is maintained as work lands; the REVIEW_READY mark is only
valid when this section says the complete both-direction matrix, resource
gates and acceptance integration have passed, with evidence below.

## 1. Branch / base / state

- Branch: `agent/rfc-kimi-neutral-v2`, worktree `/work/worktrees/pipestream-rfc-kimi`.
- Base: `8eb5a17` on `feat/durable-work-results-v2` (contains `82a1b11`).
- Peer dependency consumed: Claude `5e3138a` (SERVER_READY+CLIENT_READY
  provisional) merged at `bc791fb`; merge-scope checked (25 files, all
  Claude-owned, no new transitive deps).
- Nothing merged into the shared feature branch or main; no push
  performed (push authorization not given); no force operations.
- Dirty state: none at last update except pre-existing fmt-only diffs in
  `src/v2/authority/admission.rs:1` and `scopes.rs:478` (not mine, not
  touched).

## 3. Verification evidence (latest full state)

- `cargo test -p pipestream-conformance`: 65 passed / 0 failed (baseline
  was 24 before this assignment).
- `cargo clippy --all-targets -p pipestream-conformance -- -D warnings`:
  clean. `cargo fmt --check`: clean for the crate. Production crates
  after 152c280: clippy/fmt clean; core 470, quinn 236, server 12 tests
  green.
- One load-sensitive 20 s watch timeout in
  `cli_reopens_committed_work…` observed under concurrent build load;
  passed isolated and full re-runs. Recorded, not dismissed; watch for
  recurrence.
- Dev runs (all INCOMPLETE-labelled, never PASS): archived under
  `conformance/results/async-neutral-v2/runs/` with MANIFEST.sha256 per
  run: `durable-18d3849c6bd74b8b` (M6), `durable-18d385c7335e12e0` (M7),
  `durable-18d388dba0c3da34` (M8, 433 entries re-verified).
- Implemented rows at M8: 21 (g1-leaf-copy, g1 batch A ×5, g2 ×7 hook
  rows + 3 hook-free, g5 ×5) with direction coverage per traceability.md;
  the G2 hooked rows cover all three directions except where the
  named Java gaps (below) force INCOMPLETE markers.
- Subject binary pins: rust release `pipestream-quinn` sha256
  `097829fa45d8c03eb0a5594badf0cfceababdc6d8c4898d8ce497426ec7406d7`
  (post-152c280); Java all-jar `ff537a609119534db8caca50d2828a4d421b8b0997ca04896883fff9cc60375b`
  (f582341 build; shaded-jar timestamps make cross-host hash equality
  unlikely — per-run hashes are recorded in run.tsv instead).

## 4. Interface and peer-review artifacts

- interface-v1.md: event + schedule schemas; acknowledged by Claude
  (1452f60, hash independently recomputed) and Meta (schedule schema).
- rust-hook-proposal.md + addendum: placement agreed with Claude
  (his peer-review-kimi-rust-hooks.md); M5 implements the amended
  contract.
- peer-review-claude-java-hooks.md: 4 defects + 2 gap groups; Claude
  accepted, fixes landing in his FixtureMain checkpoint.
- peer-review-meta-contract-c1.md: no blocking mismatch; Meta's answers
  accepted (reviews/kimi-interface-v1.md).

## 5. Known limitations / open gates

1. Acceptance mode has never passed: the full matrix, both directions,
   resource gates and run_all.sh integration are unfinished.
2. Java-server hook directions are live for 5 G2 rows (M7), but
   `g2-crash-after-create-commit` rust-client/java-server stays
   INCOMPLETE: Java FixtureMain re-fires drop-reply on the REPLAYED
   commit (no fresh-commit gating) — subject-side fix reported to Claude
   with archived transcript.
3. Java findings reported to Claude (all with archived reproducers):
   CLI ignores `--max-execution-ms`; client graceful shutdown hangs
   after a server kill; watch output lacks the deadline field; select
   on an empty manifest throws client-side FRAME_ERROR instead of
   surfacing wire NOT_FOUND; `--entities` required blocks empty-batch
   declaration cases; pause release-file naming
   (`release-<target>-<boundary>`) differs from interface-v1
   (`release-<boundary>`) — reconciliation proposed.
4. g7-unsafe-clock-refusal needs a subject fixture clock (proposal
   pending); host UTC is never used.
5. require-durable and wire-level cross-owner paths are unreachable via
   the published CLIs (recorded findings, M4) — final certification of
   those arms needs either CLI surface or documented implementation-test
   mapping. Rust authority capacity bounds make the 256/batch schema
   bound wire-unreachable (single-tx cap binds first); 257-batch is
   preempted by clap arity — both named gaps.
6. My all-jar predates Claude's quiche pipestream.4 transport fix
   (MAX_STREAMS credit leak; rebuild queued behind Meta's BENCHMARK.lock
   dt-full run) — r-* and g6-stopped-* rows must run against the FIXED
   transport before acceptance.
7. Client-side commit boundaries are driver-side observations only;
   uncontrolled client-death rows are labelled as such.
8. g2-drop-reply-publication is registered but unimplemented: neither
   subject exposes a PUBLICATION reply pair to withhold (publication is
   observed via watch, not a correlated reply); the kill-at-boundary
   variant is the delivered evidence.

## 6. Safe next action

Continue matrix implementation per traceability.md (G2 lost-ACK rows
landing in M6, then G1 lifecycle three directions, G3 storage, G4 races
with hooks, G7/G8, G6 probes, R resources), then acceptance-mode
integration into conformance/run_all.sh and the final full-matrix run.
