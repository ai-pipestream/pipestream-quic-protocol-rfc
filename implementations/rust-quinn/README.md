# Rust feature-complete exemplar

The Rust implementation is the feature-complete exemplar for PipeStream Layers
0 and 1 plus the draft's narrow durable-yield Layer 2 profile. It remains
non-normative: the specification, CDDL, and frozen conformance vectors are the
authority.

The workspace separates protocol behavior from transport and deployment:

- `pipestream-core` contains the independent wire codec, entity and scope state
  machines, manifests, completion policies, checkpoints, claim state, lineage
  digests, and persistence interfaces. It has no Quinn dependency.
- `pipestream-quinn` contains TLS 1.3 and ALPN setup, QUIC stream handling,
  out-of-order chunk reassembly, the reusable client, and the embeddable server.
- `pipestream-server` builds the `pipestream-quinn` command-line server and
  scenario client.
- `pipestream-conformance` is a protocol-neutral process driver. It does not
  depend on any PipeStream crate and is not a fourth implementation.

```bash
cargo test --locked
cargo build --release --locked
```

The original `serve` and `send` commands retain the common Layer 0 black-box
contract documented under `conformance/`. The durable server uses:

```bash
target/release/pipestream-quinn serve-recursive \
  --bind 127.0.0.1:9443 \
  --cert server.crt --key server.key \
  --state-db state/sessions.sqlite3 \
  --entity-dir state/entities
```

`serve-recursive` accepts concurrent connections with a configurable bound,
enforces scope depth, entity-count, frame, chunk-count, and payload limits, and
persists state transitions before reporting them. SQLite runs in WAL mode with
full synchronous durability and checksummed, versioned session records. Payload
objects and final lineage digests are immutable, fsynced files. Startup resumes
claims that were durably redeemed but interrupted before completion.

The public `RecursiveService`, `RecursiveServer`, `RecursiveClient`,
`EntityProcessor`, `EntityStore`, and `SessionStore` APIs support embedding the
same behavior without the command-line process. Applications provide processing
and storage behavior while the service owns protocol transitions and durable
state.

The Layer 1 end-to-end scenario is runnable with `recursive-scenario`. It sends
one root, three children, and two grandchildren; completes descendants out of
order; verifies nested scope digests; crosses scope barriers and checkpoints;
rehydrates both parents; and persists a deterministic final lineage digest.
`begin-yield` and `redeem` exercise disconnect, cross-server claim redemption,
single-use replay refusal, and recovery.

All transport paths require TLS 1.3 with ALPN `pipestream/1`; 0-RTT is never
enabled. The implemented Layer 2 scope is intentionally narrow. Automatic retry
scheduling, claim federation between unrelated persistence domains, and the
other optional resilience behaviors are not claimed.
