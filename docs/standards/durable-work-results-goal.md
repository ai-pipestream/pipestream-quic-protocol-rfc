# Durable work, results, and usefulness: execution record

Status: active, not accepted. Baseline: `68b02ea55169187da123b7efa0f6045718fbb645`.
The user approved all three tasks in the goal objective attached on 2026-09-06.
This record preserves the complete scope; an intermediate commit is not completion.

## Required order and acceptance evidence

### 1. Complete the contract

Make "I submitted work, disconnected, and returned: what happened, and where is
my output?" interoperably answerable. Required deliverables:

- A small mandatory Core and explicitly negotiated durable-work/result profiles.
- Stable owner-qualified work identity, distinct attempts, and safe anti-reuse rules.
- First-class result streams and authenticated output references, bound to the
  input, logical work, producing attempt, and authority.
- An explicit successor composing sealed work, caller authentication, retained
  recovery, authorized cancellation/retry, and stale-publication fencing.
- Separate execution deadlines, input/output retention, receipt replay,
  authorization expiry, and anti-reuse history. Active work cannot expire out
  of observability merely because 24 hours elapsed.
- Exact completion-count partitions and scope-qualified shutdown cuts.
- Revised normative source, explicit wire/version compatibility, frozen valid
  and invalid wire examples, and an executable bounded failure-state model.

Acceptance: no unresolved admission, outcome authority, publication, or closure
semantics within the selected profiles. Build/render/inspect the draft, validate
its CDDL, check the vectors independently, run the model with reported bounds
and counterexample traces, and review security/resource invariants. A model is
not implementation conformance or an unbounded proof.

### 2. Independent Rust and Java implementations and failure driver

Implement the same complete profile combination in both existing libraries,
including Java caller authentication, result delivery, and sealed recovery.
Do not substitute legacy subset tests or shared protocol code. Keep C++ at its
existing subset until this contract survives the required work.

The protocol-neutral Rust driver must cover both language directions and:

- Crashes on both sides of durable commits and lost acknowledgments.
- Duplicates, stream reorder, missing descendants, and stale attempts.
- Cancellation versus completion/result publication.
- Unauthorized replay, changed principals, malformed frames, resource exhaustion.
- Slow consumers and payloads larger than receiver flow-control windows.
- Retention expiry and crash-safe cleanup.

Acceptance: trace every mandatory selected-profile requirement to tests;
cross-language outcomes and named refusals agree, restart works, and measured
resource bounds hold. Preserve full existing regression gates. Report heap,
native/process memory, disk-file lengths and actual I/O with their own scopes;
do not substitute one for another.

### 3. External workload and equivalent streaming-gRPC baseline

An application outside the reference implementation must stream chunks,
distribute real transformations, return real output, and reconstruct the
result. Exercise reconnect and worker failure during execution.

Implement the same workload over streaming gRPC with equivalent authentication,
persistence, retry rules, processing and output guarantees. Measure time to first
usable output, total completion, tail/recovery latency, CPU, heap, total process
memory, disk I/O, network bytes, coordination code/state, and failure correctness.

Acceptance: reproducible commands, pinned builds, raw measurements, failure
traces, and an honest report of improvements, regressions and simplifications.
Feed results back into normative source and implementation status. Lower
coordination complexity is a possible benefit; faster transport is not assumed.

## Execution decisions

- Reducing mandatory version-1 behavior requires a new major protocol mapping;
  do not weaken what `pipestream/1` or an existing extension ID promises.
- Separate work identity from attempt identity and result delivery observations.
  Neither disconnect nor result-stream reset authorizes execution.
- Use Rust for the independent model/driver. No Python implementation,
  conformance oracle, example or benchmark harness.
- Forgejo is the source of truth; use normal PRs and preserve other merges.
  GitHub is a downstream mirror. No force push, deployment, live-cluster change,
  or IETF submission is authorized by completion of this goal.

## Progress and outstanding work

The first increment adds the lifecycle decision record and two independent
bounded state models to the Rust conformance driver. The full suite now runs
`modelcheck --depth 32 --max-states 1000000`.

The actual finite graphs contain 311,539 work-model states and 5,776 scope-model
states, with 8,723,092 and 173,280 checked edges respectively. Their longest
shortest paths are 19 and 17 transitions; both searches finish with no depth
frontier. All 14 deliberately incorrect rule variants produce counterexamples.
The model tests also exercise insufficient state budgets and named successful
recovery/cancellation/cleanup traces. These are separate models, not a proof
of their composition or of real storage, cryptography, networking or liveness.

Decisions captured include a new major mapping for reduced Core, stable logical
work versus attempt identity, explicit retry without deadline extension,
post-terminal replay retention, result publication fencing, immutable scope
membership, four final count buckets, empty scopes and root-qualified shutdown.

These are inputs to the normative wire contract, not a replacement for it.
Next: finalize the version-2 normative mapping, profile negotiation, session
creation and anti-reuse, correlated operations, result manifests/streams and
reference retrieval, lifetime/clock rules and refusal codes; then freeze CDDL
and wire examples and check composition. No new profile is advertised yet.
All three acceptance sections above remain open until their complete evidence
is recorded and audited against the actual repository.

### Initial model increment validation (2026-09-06)

- `./conformance/run_all.sh`: exit 0. Formatting, strict workspace clippy,
  328 Rust workspace tests, frozen version-1 vectors and CDDL, the two models,
  193 Java reference tests, native SQLite/C++, nine client/server pairings,
  32 raw QUIC capability probes, recursive/recovery scenarios and all three
  external examples passed. Java counts were read from 20 Surefire XML reports:
  zero failures, errors or skips. This is local evidence, not hosted CI.
- After selecting 32 as the CLI's default exploration depth, focused formatting,
  all 18 conformance-crate tests, strict clippy and the default release
  `modelcheck` command passed again. The full suite uses an explicit depth of 32.
- `git diff --check`: passed. No production protocol codec, wire schema,
  immutable vector, database format, reference server or dependency changed.
- Logs: `/tmp/pipestream-successor-model-conformance.log` and
  `/tmp/pipestream-durable-work-model.log` on the validation host. Java still
  emits its existing Netty `sun.misc.Unsafe` deprecation warning.

This increment does not complete task 1, task 2 or task 3. The next increment
must implement the normative contract rather than treating model success as
wire interoperability or replacing the remaining implementation/benchmark work.
