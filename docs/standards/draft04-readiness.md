# Draft-04 readiness and implementation evidence

Updated 2026-09-05. This landing starts from `00531de` and addresses the
[protocol review](../ai-slop/ietf-protocol-review-2026-09.md).
The specification remains an individual Internet-Draft, not an approved
standard. No implementation in this repository demonstrates full conformance.

## Changes and regression coverage

| Review item | Implemented change | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| R1 | Validate received maps before applying optional defaults; Java/C++ accept core recursive capability limits when downgrading | `test-vectors/optional-fields.tsv`, consumed by all three codecs |
| R2 | Omitted checkpoint flags decode as zero without false deterministic-encoding refusal | Same shared vectors |
| R3 | Recursive Rust skips unknown control frames after negotiation | `r3_r4_unknown_frame_and_entity_without_pending` |
| R4 | Entity reception does not require PENDING | Same raw-QUIC test |
| R5 | Announcements are matched by entity identity, not stream acceptance order | `r5_announcements_do_not_order_entity_streams` |
| R6 | Pending checkpoints allow descendant progress, use monotonic deadlines, and emit a named timeout | Two checkpoint wire tests |
| R7 | Session construction uses negotiated depth and entity limits | `r7_negotiated_depth_is_enforced_before_payload_storage` |
| R8 | A processor yield cannot emit Layer 2 statuses on a Layer 0 connection | `r8_layer0_never_receives_layer2_statuses` |
| R9 | Checkpoint ACK identity is compared exactly; claim, digest, and barrier correlation is also checked | `r9_mismatched_checkpoint_ack_is_refused`; happy-path recursive and recovery scenarios |
| R10 | Quorum uses shortest exact CBOR floats and an integer-computed success threshold | Deterministic encoding tests, corrected recursive vector, `quorum_threshold_uses_exact_integer_rounding` |
| R11 | Recovery and redemption callbacks serialize under the same SQLite transaction mechanism | `concurrent_recovery_serializes_resume_across_store_handles` checks one callback across concurrent recoverers |
| Admission | Invalid parent/depth/identity and digest failures occur before application callbacks or payload writes | Callback counters and absent-child-storage assertions in wire tests |
| Resource handling | Independent bounded stream readers; aggregate receive/chunk budgets; incremental control-body allocation | Stalled-stream and aggregate-chunk-limit wire tests |
| URI | Typed session/entity/claim locators, explicit port and numeric bounds, no userinfo or bearer secrets | Core URI acceptance and refusal tests |
| Evidence integrity | Actual Appendix C/CDDL definition comparison; independent expected local receipt calculation | Conformance schema drift test and recursive CLI receipt equality checks |

The wire tests are in `implementations/rust-quinn/quinn/tests/draft04_wire.rs`.
The coverage above is a review-finding matrix, not a requirement-to-test matrix
for every MUST in the specification. Unlisted behaviors are not implicitly
verified. All implementations still need that complete matrix.

## Standard changes

- Normative QUIC TLS mapping reference, corrected WebTransport comparison,
  and explicit UDP connection-failure behavior.
- Precise omitted-field and binary16/binary32 representation rules.
- Exact quorum threshold and partial-success semantics.
- Pending-checkpoint timeout, duplicate-request deadline behavior, and an
  admission requirement preventing checkpoints from overtaking their own cut.
- Scope status hashes explicitly distinguished from content receipts and
  proof of correct computation.
- Authentication, authorization, principal/session/authority binding,
  retention, revocation, and external-effect idempotency requirements.
- Tagged `pipestream://` resource paths, a required port, bounded identifiers,
  and explicit separation of locators from access credentials.
- Specification Required registry policies, registration templates, yield
  reasons, and checkpoint-timeout error 0x0E. Error 0x06 is named
  PIPESTREAM_LIMIT_EXCEEDED to cover payload and aggregate resource limits.
- Factual implementation status and an explicit open-issues appendix.

## Validation

`./conformance/run_all.sh` runs Rust formatting, Clippy with warnings denied,
the workspace tests, Java tests, C++ CTest, both Rust example suites, the
frozen-vector and CDDL checks, all nine client/server pairings, both recursive
and recovery CLI scenarios, and all three cross-language applications.
The complete command passed locally on 2026-09-05, including 45 Rust workspace
tests, the admission and aggregate-budget regressions, and all nine pairings.

`./build.sh core 04` produced XML, text, and HTML. idnits reported zero errors,
zero flaws, zero warnings, and one informational possible-downref comment
for the NIST FIPS 180-4 normative reference. This is document validation,
not distributed-protocol validation. The build now refuses a filename
revision that differs from the source XML docName.

These are local results, not hosted CI or independent implementer review.
No Python implementation, protocol oracle, or example was added. The external
xml2rfc renderer remains confined to document authoring.

## Still required before a conformance or deployment claim

1. Define and implement work-set declaration/sealing, ownership-qualified IDs,
   recycling epochs or non-reuse, scoped cursors, and GOAWAY's identity cut.
   The admission restriction improves current checkpoints but does not solve
   the complete descendant-set problem.
2. Add interoperable supported/required extension negotiation and an
   authenticated resilience profile with principal-bound claims, durable
   executor fencing, and retained outcomes for lost redemption ACKs. The
   current Layer 2 boolean advertises more than the prototype implements.
3. Add bounded spool-backed payload processing and an asynchronous application
   executor, then complete Java from the clarified text and cross-test the
   entire state machine. C++ follows as the third implementation.

Additional gaps include Layer 0 dehydration, arbitrary bidirectional work
origination, child-before-parent admission buffering, automatic retry/timer
policies, authorization tests, crash-boundary coverage, and measured resource
and performance gates. The standalone durable service authenticates only the
server and must not be exposed as an untrusted multi-tenant service.

SQLite IMMEDIATE transactions prevent simultaneous recovery callbacks through
one database, including separate store handles. They serialize writers and
require bounded, non-reentrant callbacks. They do not guarantee exactly-once
effects across a crash, nor do they fence unrelated databases.

## Submission and adoption

See [the draft-04 checklist](../../advocacy/SUBMISSION-CHECKLIST-04.md).
A published draft, a merged repository branch, working-group adoption, IESG
approval, and IANA registration are separate milestones. Document checks
and language count do not establish adoption, approval, or registration.
